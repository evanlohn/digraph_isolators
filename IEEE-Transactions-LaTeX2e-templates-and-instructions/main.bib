abstract = {There are many complex combinatorial problems which involve searching for an undirected graph satisfying given constraints. Such problems are often highly challenging because of the large number of isomorphic representations of their solutions. This paper introduces effective and compact, complete symmetry breaking constraints for small graph search. Enumerating with these symmetry breaks generates all and only non-isomorphic solutions. For small search problems, with up to 10 vertices, we compute instance independent symmetry breaking constraints. For small search problems with a larger number of vertices we demonstrate the computation of instance dependent constraints which are complete. We illustrate the application of complete symmetry breaking constraints to extend two known sequences from the OEIS related to graph enumeration. We also demonstrate the application of a generalization of our approach to fully-interchangeable matrix search problems.},

This recurrence gives the lower bound w(r,p+1)>pr−12p when r≤p, which generalizes Berlekamp’s theorem on 2-colorings, and gives the best known bound for a large interval of r. The recurrence can also be used to construct explicit valid colorings, and it improves known lower bounds on small van der {W}aerden numbers.}

This paper presents a methodology based on abstraction and symmetry breaking that applies to solve hard graph edge-coloring problems. The utility of this methodology is demonstrated by using it to compute the value R(4, 3, 3) = 30. Along the way it is required to first compute the previously unknown set (3,3,3;13)$mathcal {R}(3,3,3;13)$ consisting of 78,892 Ramsey colorings.},

The conjecture is false for this dimension if and only if at least one of the graphs contains a clique of size {\$}{\$}2^7 = 128{\$}{\$}. We present an automated method to solve this conjecture by encoding the existence of such a clique as a propositional formula. We apply satisfiability solving combined with symmetry-breaking techniques to determine that no such clique exists. This result implies that every unit cube tiling of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}^7{\$}{\$}contains a facesharing pair of cubes. Since a faceshare-free unit cube tiling of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}^8{\$}{\$}exists (which we also verify), this completely resolves Keller's conjecture.",

abstract="The boolean Pythagorean Triples problem has been a longstanding open problem in Ramsey Theory: Can the set {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}N{\}}= {\backslash}{\{}1,2,{\backslash}dots {\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}of natural numbers be divided into two parts, such that no part contains a triple (a, b, c) with {\$}{\$}a^2 + b^2 = c^2{\$}{\$}? A prize for the solution was offered by Ronald Graham over two decades ago. We solve this problem, proving in fact the impossibility, by using the Cube-and-Conquer paradigm, a hybrid SAT method for hard problems, employing both look-ahead and CDCL solvers. An important role is played by dedicated look-ahead heuristics, which indeed allowed to solve the problem on a cluster with 800 cores in about 2 days. Due to the general interest in this mathematical problem, our result requires a formal proof. Exploiting recent progress in unsatisfiability proofs of SAT solvers, we produced and verified a proof in the DRAT format, which is almost 200 terabytes in size. From this we extracted and made available a compressed certificate of 68 gigabytes, that allows anyone to reconstruct the DRAT proof for checking.",

While the basic model counting problem requires computing the number of all solutions to the given formula, in some important application scenarios, the desired count is not of all solutions, but instead, of all unique solutions up to isomorphism. In such a scenario, the user herself must try to either use the full count that the model counter returns to compute the count up to isomorphism, or ensure that the input formula to the model counter adequately captures the symmetry breaking predicates so it can directly report the count she desires.",
